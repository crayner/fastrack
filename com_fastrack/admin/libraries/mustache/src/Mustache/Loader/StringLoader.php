 * Mustache Template string Loader implementation.

 *     $loader = new StringLoader;
 *     $tpl = $loader->load('{{ foo }}'); // '{{ foo }}'
 *
 * This is the default Template Loader instance used by Mustache:
 *
 *     $m = new Mustache;
 *     $tpl = $m->loadTemplate('{{ foo }}');
 *     echo $tpl->render(array('foo' => 'bar')); // "bar"
